# KernelSU-SUSFS-Kernel-for-Oneplus-13-with-ColorOS-15.0.0.502-With-Turbo-Game-Core-Compatible

Use it ***AT YOUR OWN RISK***!

**Do NOT** use it for Oneplus ACE series for they have different dtbo partitions. 

 Chinese version of Oneplus 13 contains Turbo Game Core and the kernel is different from global one, marked as "abogki" instead of abgki. Simply flashing the general gki to obtain root will definitely cause bootloop. 
This version of anykernel3 flash dtbo image as well to fix bootloop while keeping the Turbo Game Core.
